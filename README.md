# GoTrack

A program to create graphs for any osu players and their stats based on the osutrack API.

This project uses Fyne as a library for the GUI. 

TODO:
Figure out how to get multiple users and their stats to the chart data
Need to finish Fyne GUI so that stats can be filtered to/from chart based on menu items
Set up settings.go so that Fyne GUI can be used to select which stats I want shown in the charts.
Make everything in chart.go dynamic so everything can be set from GUI and settings.go
Fix the errors in chart.go
